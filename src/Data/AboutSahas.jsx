        topic: "About Sahas Saving and Credit Cooperative Limited",
        detail: "This cooperative was founded in the midst of an unprecedented global economic crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019. As the world was grappling with the devastating effects of the coronavirus, its impact went far beyond public health. It triggered a deep and prolonged financial downturn, affecting economies both large and small. Nepal, like many developing nations, was not spared. Amid such turmoil and uncertainty, a group of visionary individuals came together with a shared mission—to create a reliable financial institution that would serve the needs of the community while also promoting long-term financial resilience. Thus, our cooperative was born, standing as a symbol of hope and stability during one of the most challenging periods in modern history.\n\nOver the years, we have continued to grow and evolve, facing challenges head-on and transforming obstacles into opportunities. From our humble beginnings with only 37 founding members, we have now expanded to include 351 active members as of Ashadh 2081. This growth has not happened by chance. It is the result of the trust and loyalty of our members, the commitment of our team, and a consistent vision focused on sustainable development and inclusive financial services. Despite operating in a volatile economic environment for several years, our cooperative has succeeded in protecting the financial interests of its members and staff alike. We have not only shielded ourselves from the worst effects of the economic downturn but also managed to strengthen our foundation and achieve meaningful progress.\n\nOne of our key priorities has always been the integration of modern infrastructure and technology. We are proud to operate with a fully digitized system supported by advanced cooperative management software. This has enhanced the transparency, speed, and reliability of our services, allowing us to deliver an improved member experience and ensure accountability in our operations. Our office space, equipped with member-friendly facilities and a welcoming environment, reflects our commitment to professionalism and service excellence.\n\nOur financial performance in recent years underscores the resilience and efficiency of our institution. Even as global and national markets experienced instability, our cooperative witnessed significant growth across various areas of operation. The number of active saving accounts has reached 1514, covering diverse schemes such as regular savings, children’s savings, women’s savings, senior citizen savings, festival savings, and several other optional and monthly saving plans. This diversification not only caters to different segments of our society but also builds a broader financial base for our cooperative.\n\nIn terms of financial indicators, the past year has been particularly encouraging. Although share capital growth slowed down slightly due to the prevailing economic conditions, our savings deposits increased by 38.85%, a testament to the trust our members continue to place in us. Likewise, our reserve fund saw an exceptional rise of 381.07%, enabling us to further strengthen our risk management capabilities. Other funds also grew by 15.48%, and loan investment rose by 12.03%, reflecting the growing demand for credit among our members and our institution's ability to meet that demand responsibly. Furthermore, the total balance sheet saw an 8.24% increase, confirming our solid financial standing and the efficiency of our operational strategies.\n\nOur cooperative is not just a financial institution—it is a community-driven platform built on the values of mutual support, transparency, and shared growth. We strongly believe in the power of cooperation to bring about meaningful change, not only in the financial wellbeing of individuals but also in the broader social and economic development of the community. Our members are at the heart of everything we do, and their active participation and support are the reasons for our continued success. Every saving, every loan, and every service we provide is designed with their needs in mind, aiming to build a secure and prosperous future for all.\n\nLooking ahead, our vision is to establish ourselves as one of Nepal’s leading cooperatives, known not only for its financial strength but also for its contributions to social transformation and sustainable development. We are committed to advancing with science and technology, adopting innovative solutions, and introducing modern financial products that meet the evolving needs of our members. At the same time, we remain deeply rooted in our founding principles of inclusivity, community welfare, and ethical practices. As we continue this journey, we do so with immense gratitude to our members, staff, and stakeholders. Their unwavering support has been instrumental in shaping our progress thus far. With confidence and commitment, we reaffirm our dedication to work tirelessly for the satisfaction of our shareholders and the greater good of our society. Together, we look forward to a future filled with hope, progress, and shared prosperity."
